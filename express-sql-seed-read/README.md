## Adding a Database to our Express App

## Rebuild a back-end API

Earlier in this module, we built two apps: a back-end API that serves JSON and bookmarks front-end.

You will rebuild the backend API in order to review Express and learn how to add a database in.

Sometimes, rebuilding something can seem less exciting than trying something new. However, being able to compare and contrast the differences will help solidify what you have already learned and what parts are new.
